Our Commit/Review Process:
- Create your branch
- Write code on your branch
- Push finished code to your branch
- Create a pull request with your code, describing what you did
- Comment @ someone in issue to review your code
- Only after a LGTM (looks good to me) can code be pushed to master

Our Done criteria:
- Has been reviewed by at least one other team member
- The review must include running through the process of the individual user story that was completed
- Only after this can it be moved to Done
- Only then can it be closed
